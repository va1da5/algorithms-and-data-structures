    "\n",
    "A tree data structure is a hierarchical model used to organize data in a way that resembles a tree, consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has a root node at the top, which branches out to child nodes, forming a parent-child relationship. Nodes can have zero or more children, and the structure allows for efficient data retrieval, insertion, and deletion. Trees are commonly used in computer science for various applications, such as representing hierarchical data (like file systems), facilitating search operations (like binary search trees), and managing sorted data (like AVL trees).\n",

    "- **root** - the most parent node. The First. Adam.\n",
    "- **height** - The longest path from the root to the most child node binary tree - a tree in which has at most 2 children, at least 0 - **children general tree** - a tree with 0 or more children\n",
    "- **binary search tree** - a tree in which has a specific ordering to the nodes and at most 2 children leaves - a node without children\n",
    "- **balanced** - A tree is perfectly balanced when any node's left and right children have the same height.\n",
    "- **branching factor** - the amount of children a tree has.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Depth First Search (DFS)** is an algorithm used for traversing or searching through data structures like trees and graphs. It starts at a selected node (the root in trees) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This means it goes deep into one path until it can no longer continue, then it backtracks to explore other paths. DFS can be implemented using a stack data structure or through recursion. It is useful for tasks such as path-finding, solving puzzles, and exploring networks."

It explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. BFS uses a **queue data structure** to keep track of nodes that need to be explored. This approach ensures that the shortest path in terms of the number of edges is found in unweighted graphs. BFS is commonly used in various applications, including finding the shortest path in navigation systems, web crawling, and network broadcasting."
