    "A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (or nodes) connected by edges (or links). It is used to represent relationships or connections between pairs of objects. Graphs can be directed (where edges have a direction) or undirected (where edges do not have a direction). They can also be weighted (where edges have values) or unweighted. Graphs are commonly used in various applications, such as social networks, transportation systems, and network topology, to model complex relationships and facilitate analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph can be represented in several ways, primarily through:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjacency List**: A collection of lists or arrays where each list corresponds to a vertex and contains the vertices that are directly connected to it. This representation is more space-efficient for sparse graphs.\n",
    "- **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array where the rows and columns represent vertices, and the cell values indicate whether an edge exists between the vertices. For example, a value of 1 indicates an edge, while 0 indicates no edge. Takes a lot of memory due to being of `O(V^2)` complexity, therefore rarely used.\n",
    "- **Edge List**: A list of pairs (or tuples) where each pair represents an edge connecting two vertices. This is a simple and straightforward representation."

    "Dijkstra's Shortest Path is an algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It works by iteratively selecting the closest unvisited node, updating the distances to its neighbors, and marking it as visited until all nodes have been processed or the shortest path to a specific target node is found. The algorithm is efficient for graphs with non-negative edge weights and is widely used in various applications, such as GPS navigation and network routing."
